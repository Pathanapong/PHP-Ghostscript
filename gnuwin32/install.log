Author's note (Jay Satiro <raysatiro@users.sourceforge.net>) :

Last updated December 26, 2017

WARNING: GnuWin32 has not been updated in several years. I have left this
script and our GetGnuWin32 downloader functional for legacy purposes. If you
need the latest packages consider using MSYS2 MINGW or Cygwin instead.

Some of the packages available with the gnuwin32 project are wildly outdated.
I have compiled more recent builds of the following utilities:

UnZip 6.00, OpenSSL 1.0.2n, Wget 1.12.1-dev, Sort 7.6

Would you like more information? [yes]


UnZip 6.00; unzip.exe (2009-04-20) (bugfixes, security fixes)
^ Suggested replacement for GnuWin32 UnZip 5.51 of May 2004

OpenSSL 1.0.2n; all binary files (2017-12-07) (bugfixes, security fixes)
^ Suggested replacement for GnuWin32 OpenSSL 0.9.8h of May 2008

Wget 1.12.1-dev; wget.exe (2010-06-23) (bugfixes, security fixes)
>> No international support, and english help text only.
>> Built from wget mainline 013c8e2f5997 2010-03-04
^^ Suggested replacement for GnuWin32 Wget 1.11.4 of Jun 2008

Bundle of CA Root Certificates; cacert.pem (2017-09-20)
>> Extracted from Mozilla Certificate Authorities list.
^^ Suggested replacement for <unknown>

Sort 7.6 testbuild; sort-7.6.exe (2009-09-11) (bugfixes)
>> Properly supports LC_ALL environment variable. Test build.
^^ Suggested supplement to GnuWin32 Sort 5.3.0 of April 2005


Would you like to install these utilities? [yes]


Please type the existing directory you want to install to and hit enter.
["C:\gnuwin32\bin"]
If it is the directory above that's in brackets, you can just hit enter.

Done replacing utilities.
Done installing supplemental utilities.
Invocation examples for supplemental utilities:

sort-7.6 --help

! Please note that previous versions of this program installed the latest
! wget as a supplement (wget-1.12.exe). The latest version of wget now
! replaces its older version. Invoke it the same as you otherwise would.
! For example:
wget --version

Ending supplemental install.

The 'Start Menu' folder has been created in your installation directory.
This folder contains all links to documentation.

If you move your installation folder, please run the update-links.bat
*in your installation directory* to refresh your documentation links.

Ending documentation link updater.


Optional:
You can *append* the bin subdir of your installation folder to your PATH:
i.e. C:\gnuwin32\bin
There are a few gnu conflicts with Windows utilities, so make sure to *append*.
That way the windows utilities take priority (i.e. sort).
*!!!!!! Please read README.txt for more information on your installation !!!!!*

Done installing. yay. Have fun!
