GetGnuWin32 is no longer functional. Use a package manager maintained
for Windows 11 or whatever the latest Windows is at the time you read
this. Such as MSYS2, Cygwin, WSL or Chocolatey.

Details:

Development on the GnuWin32 project ended approximately 15 years ago.

Development on the GetGnuWin32 project ended approximately 6 years ago.

At the time I left GetGnuWin32 functional for legacy purposes. Recently
however, GetGnuWin32's downloader stopped working due to changes in
sourceforge's website. I will not fix it.

I've created an archive GetGnuWin32_legacy_install_archive.zip that
contains the last known working installation of all non-conflicting
GnuWin32 packages installed to the C:\gnuwin32 folder. It is a copy of
what a working GetGnuWin32 package manager would have given you.

After installation users would often choose to manually append the
folder C:\gnuwin32\bin to the system PATH environment variable
(important: append, do not prepend).

This archive is for LEGACY PURPOSES ONLY. For example if you have a
really old Windows guest OS VM then there is some value.

Thanks to Mathias Michaelis, Kees Zeelenberg and all hackers that
